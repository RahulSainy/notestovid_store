Protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons are neutral. Surrounding the nucleus are electrons, tiny negatively charged particles that orbit in specific shells.\n\n## Slide 3\n\n-", "image_url": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/198/2016/11/23210246/1-2-1.jpeg", "image_path": "data/videos/a5ea628b-3b54-440c-b22a-39cc195b8df5/images/image_2.webp"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "Atomic Number and Mass Number", "slide_type": "Two Columns", "content": ["- **Column 1:**", "- **Atomic Number:** The number of protons in an atom's nucleus.

Isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both isotopes of carbon, differing only in their number of neutrons.\n\n## Slide 5\n\n-", "image_url": "https://rwu.pressbooks.pub/app/uploads/sites/29/2020/07/image3.png", "image_path": "data/videos/a5ea628b-3b54-440c-b22a-39cc195b8df5/images/image_4.webp"}, {"slide_number": "5", "title": "The Periodic Table", "slide_type": "Image with Caption", "content": ["- (No additional content for this slide)"], "image_desc": "- A colorful image of the periodic table of elements, showing the arrangement of elements based on their atomic number and properties.", "narration": "The periodic table is a powerful tool that organizes all known elements based on their atomic number and properties.
