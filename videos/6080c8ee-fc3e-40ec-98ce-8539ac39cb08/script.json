It's a continuous journey of water, moving from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back again. The sun's energy powers this cycle, causing water to evaporate and rise into the air. As the water vapor cools, it condenses into clouds. When the clouds become full, water falls back to Earth as precipitation, like rain, snow, or hail. This water then collects in bodies of water, like rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the cycle begins again.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://cdn5.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/13/64/water-cycle-of-evaporation-condensation-vector-44481364.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/6080c8ee-fc3e-40ec-98ce-8539ac39cb08/images/image_1.webp"}]
