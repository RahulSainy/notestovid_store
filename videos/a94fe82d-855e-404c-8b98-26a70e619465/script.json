Type: illustration", "video_desc": "", "narration": "Special relativity introduced in nineteenohfive rests on two fundamental postulates. Firstly the laws of physics are consistent for everyone moving at a constant speed in a straight line. Secondly the speed of light is constant for all observers no matter how fast they are moving relative to the light source. These seemingly simple ideas lead to profound consequences such as time dilation and length contraction.", "image_urls": ["https://media.istockphoto.com/id/644349988/vector/retro-warp-star-light-beams.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=I1-k8_4Myzz9ClwQ4Cy2Rh9fmXlvD9t_WwSA_AMwW8k="], "image_path": "data/videos/a94fe82d-855e-404c-8b98-26a70e619465/images/image_2.webp", "video_urls": ["No Video Found"], "video_path": "data/videos/a94fe82d-855e-404c-8b98-26a70e619465/images/video_2.mp4"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "General Relativity: Gravity as Curvature", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "Gravity is not a force, but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\nMassive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them.\nLight follows the curves in spacetime, explaining the bending of light around massive objects.\nGravitational time dilation: Time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields.", "image_desc": "Spacetime curvature around a planet. Type: diagram", "video_desc": "", "narration": "General relativity published in nineteenfifteen takes the concept of gravity to a whole new level. Einstein proposed that gravity isn't a force but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Imagine a bowling ball placed on a stretched rubber sheet it creates a dip. Similarly massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them influencing the motion of other objects including light. This explains why light bends around massive objects and why time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields.", "image_urls": ["https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/r5/FirecrackerExperimentActual.png"], "image_path": "data/videos/a94fe82d-855e-404c-8b98-26a70e619465/images/image_3.webp", "video_urls": ["No Video Found"], "video_path": "data/videos/a94fe82d-855e-404c-8b98-26a70e619465/images/video_3.mp4"}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "Evidence and Implications", "slide_type": "Two Columns", "content": "**Evidence Supporting Relativity**\nBending of starlight during solar eclipses.\nGravitational lensing.\nTime dilation observed with atomic clocks on airplanes.\nGPS satellites require relativistic corrections.\n**Implications of Relativity**\nUnderstanding black holes and neutron stars.\nCosmology and the evolution of the universe.\nDevelopment of technologies like GPS.\nTheoretical framework for advanced propulsion systems.", "image_desc": "Solar eclipse, GPS satellite.
