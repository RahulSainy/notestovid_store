It works by using a ballpoint mechanism to transfer ink from a cartridge to the paper. The ink is held in a cartridge, and the nib, which is a small metal point, is attached to the ballpoint mechanism. When you press the pen against the paper, the ballpoint mechanism rotates, distributing ink evenly onto the paper. The body of the pen holds all of these components together.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://i.redd.it/k3pzndsdo2731.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/8ba63d95-0bc1-43a7-b2f3-1ad05a6f4d04/images/image_1.webp"}]
