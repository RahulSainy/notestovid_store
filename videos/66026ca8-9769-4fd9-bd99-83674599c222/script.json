Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are particularly effective for recognizing patterns in images and time series data. They've been successfully employed in identifying malware based on code structure and analyzing network traffic patterns. Imagine a CNN acting as a vigilant guard, scanning through network data to catch even the slightest signs of malware. Next up, Autoencoders, or AEs. These unsupervised models learn to reconstruct their input data, making them excellent at detecting anomalies by spotting deviations from expected patterns. We have different types of autoencoders, like Stacked Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders, each with unique strengths for cybersecurity applications. Moving on to Recurrent Neural Networks, or RNNs. RNNs are designed for sequential data, making them great for analyzing network traffic and user behavior patterns. They've been used for tasks like intrusion detection, botnet traffic analysis, and spotting unusual user activities. Lastly, Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs. GANs consist of two neural networks\u2014the generator and the discriminator\u2014that compete against each other.
