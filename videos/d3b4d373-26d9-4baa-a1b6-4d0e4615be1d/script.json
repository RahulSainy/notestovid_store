The paper was written by Mukesh Kumar, a PhD scholar, and Dr. Sitesh Kumar Sinha, a professor, both from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Rabindranath Tagore University in Raisen, Madhya Pradesh, India. Their insights provide a comprehensive look into the mechanisms behind big data classification in the cloud. The abstract gives us a snapshot of the research focus. Big data, as we know, involves enormous volumes of data that come in various forms\u2014structured and unstructured\u2014generated from sources like IoT devices, social media, videos, and more. Earlier technologies struggled to manage this vast amount of information, which is where big data classification comes in. The authors point out that handling this data is a challenge, and effective classification techniques are crucial for organizing and accessing the data efficiently.", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/data/images/enterprise-bi-adf.png", "image_path": "data/videos/d3b4d373-26d9-4baa-a1b6-4d0e4615be1d/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": ["- **Rapid growth of data:** Driven by advancements in digitalization", "**Need for automated data processing:** To bridge the gap between traditional statistics and modern database management systems", "**Data mining:** Uncovering valuable insights from large datasets"], "image_desc": "A bar graph showing the exponential growth of data over time.", "narration": "In the introduction, the paper sets the stage by discussing the rapid growth of data due to advancements in digitalization. This explosion of data, if not analyzed correctly, is essentially useless.
