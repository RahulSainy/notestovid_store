Public transportation plays a vital role in keeping this city moving, but the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) faces significant challenges in managing its bus operations efficiently. Currently, manual scheduling and route planning lead to long, tedious processes, increased chances of human error, and poor resource utilization. This means more time and money spent, with buses often running inefficiently on congested or overlapping routes.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/PY2TGE/busy-street-in-delhi-india-PY2TGE.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/5c83124e-7421-4365-bd89-3894536a5b63/images/image_1.webp"}, {"title": "Challenges DTC Faces", "content": ["- Manual scheduling is time-consuming and prone to errors.", "Resource mismanagement leads to redundant routes and underutilized buses.", "Lack of real-time adjustments results in delays and passenger dissatisfaction."], "image_desc": "A visual representation of the challenges, perhaps showing a map with overlapping bus routes, a clock symbolizing time wasted, and a frustrated passenger waiting for a bus.", "narration": "Let's delve deeper into the problems. First, scheduling buses and crews manually is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. Schedulers spend hours trying to assign the right buses to the right routes, but with so many variables, it's easy to make errors. Additionally, resource mismanagement results in redundant routes, overcrowded buses during peak hours, and underutilized buses during off-peak times. And, of course, without real-time traffic adjustments, buses often get caught in traffic jams, causing delays and passenger dissatisfaction.", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "https://cdn.slidemodel.com/wp-content/uploads/20648-01-time-infographic-illustration-for-powerpoint-16x9-2.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/5c83124e-7421-4365-bd89-3894536a5b63/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "Solution Overview - Introducing the Automated System", "content": ["- The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System is the solution.", "This system leverages AI and GIS technology for efficient operations."], "image_desc": "A modern, sleek interface showing a map with optimized bus routes, data visualizations, and AI-powered insights.", "narration": "To tackle these issues, we've developed the Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System.

First, we have Linked and Unlinked Duty Scheduling. For linked duty, a single crew remains with a bus throughout the entire shift. In unlinked duty, the system allows crews to hand over buses seamlessly, ensuring proper management of rest periods and shifts. Next, Route Management: By integrating GIS technology, the system maps out existing bus routes and provides a clear visualization of the bus network. It also highlights route overlaps and service gaps, helping planners draw new routes and optimize coverage. Additionally, AI-powered demand forecasting allows the system to predict passenger demand based on historical data, traffic patterns, and special events. This enables the system to adjust the number of buses on the road dynamically, ensuring there are always enough buses during peak hours and fewer during quieter times. Finally, the system uses real-time route optimization to make dynamic adjustments based on live traffic data. When traffic jams or accidents occur, AI will suggest alternative routes, reducing delays and improving punctuality.", "slide_number": "4", "image_url": "https://elements-cover-images-0.imgix.net/c408145e-000c-46b1-93d6-fceca55eddc3?auto=compress&crop=edges&fit=crop&fm=jpeg&h=630&w=1200&s=c442d010ffec28d7ec508a803b3a0542", "image_path": "data/videos/5c83124e-7421-4365-bd89-3894536a5b63/images/image_4.webp"}, {"title": "Technologies Used - Behind the Scenes", "content": ["- Python and Java for core algorithms and scheduling.", "React.js for a user-friendly interface.", "AI models like ARIMA, Prophet, Reinforcement Learning, and Genetic Algorithms.", "PostGIS for spatial data management and Google Maps API for real-time traffic data.", "Cloud storage using AWS or Google Cloud Platform for scalability and reliability."], "image_desc": "A diagram showing the interconnected technologies used in the system, with icons representing each technology and arrows showing data flow.", "narration": "Behind the scenes, several key technologies power this system.
