It all starts with a brain-computer interface, or BCI.  Think of it as a bridge between your thoughts and the prosthetic.  Electrodes pick up electrical signals in your brain when you imagine moving your hand.  These signals are then processed by a computer, which translates them into commands that control the prosthetic's movements.  The prosthetic itself is a marvel of engineering, with lightweight materials and robotic components that allow for a wide range of motions.", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/175437/fnins-10-00116-HTML/image_m/fnins-10-00116-g001.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/c2c286b4-b8e0-4c41-9cfe-2a5632670a50/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "Key Technologies", "image_desc": "A close-up image of a prosthetic hand with sensors and components, highlighting the EMG, machine learning algorithms, and haptic feedback.", "content": ["- **Electromyography (EMG):** Measures muscle activity from the residual limb to assist in movement.", "**Machine Learning Algorithms:** Used to improve the accuracy of interpreting brain signals.", "**Haptic Feedback:** Provides sensory feedback to the user, allowing them to feel pressure or texture through the prosthetic."], "narration": "Behind these mind-controlled prosthetics are some incredible technologies.
