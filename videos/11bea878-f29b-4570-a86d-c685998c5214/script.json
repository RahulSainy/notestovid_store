[{"title": "Refractive Index", "content": ["- **Refractive index** is a measure of how much light bends when it passes from one medium to another.", "It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium.", "The higher the refractive index, the more the light bends."], "image_desc": "A diagram showing a light ray passing from air into water, with the angle of incidence and angle of refraction labeled.", "narration": "Welcome to our presentation on refractive index. Today, we'll explore this fundamental concept in optics, understanding how it affects the way light travels through different materials.  We'll start by defining refractive index and then delve into its significance in various applications.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://us-static.z-dn.net/files/d5a/93054715c95a5a994b1b308813394edd.png", "image_path": "data/videos/11bea878-f29b-4570-a86d-c685998c5214/images/image_1.webp"}]
