Today we're diving into the world of microservices. Imagine a complex application like an online store. It has features like product browsing, checkout, user accounts, and more. Microservices help us build and manage such applications by breaking them down into smaller, independent units.", "image_url": "https://cdn-static.infotech.com/infographics/uploads/43083/4562_-_Develop_a_Value-First_Business_Automation_Strategy_1220x686_original.jpg?1693949744", "image_path": "data\\videos\\fb4a7b0f-b15f-42f3-ade8-9407a43b8d36\\images\\image_1.webp"}, {"slide_number": "2", "title": "What are Microservices?", "slide_type": "Image Left", "content": ["- Small, independent units of code", "- Each service focuses on a specific business function", "- Communicate with each other through APIs", "- Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently"], "image_desc": "A diagram showing multiple small boxes labeled with different services (e.g., \"Product Catalog\", \"Order Management\", \"User Authentication\") connected by arrows representing API calls.", "narration": "Microservices are like building blocks. Each block represents a specific function, like managing products or handling user logins. They communicate with each other through APIs, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

They speed up development by allowing teams to work independently on different services. They also make deployment and scaling much easier, as you can deploy and scale individual services without affecting others. This leads to improved resilience and fault tolerance, as failures in one service won't bring down the entire application.", "image_url": "https://d3n817fwly711g.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/08/Cross-Functional-Team-Diagram-1024x993.png", "image_path": "data\\videos\\fb4a7b0f-b15f-42f3-ade8-9407a43b8d36\\images\\image_3.webp"}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "Microservices in Action", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": ["- **E-commerce**: Product catalog, order management, payment processing", "- **Social Media**: User profiles, newsfeed, messaging", "- **Streaming Services**: Content delivery, user recommendations, billing"], "image_desc": "A collage of icons representing different industries where microservices are used: e-commerce, social media, streaming services.", "narration": "Microservices are widely used in various industries.
