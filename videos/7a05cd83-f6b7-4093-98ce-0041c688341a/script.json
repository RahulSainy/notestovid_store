Arrows pointing to close vectors could illustrate similarity.", "narration": "Hi everyone, today we're diving into vector databases. Unlike traditional databases that rely on keywords, vector databases store data as vectors\u2014essentially, points in a multi-dimensional space. This allows for semantic search, meaning you can find similar items based on their meaning, not just exact keyword matches.  Think of applications like advanced image search, recommendation systems that suggest items you might like, or even sophisticated question-answering systems.  Vector databases are key to unlocking the power of semantic understanding in data.", "image_url": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vr8gru94/production/7cade82cc1721b94f725dd5106125c404f5e74b4-1399x537.png", "image_path": "data/videos/7a05cd83-f6b7-4093-98ce-0041c688341a/images/image_1.webp"}]
