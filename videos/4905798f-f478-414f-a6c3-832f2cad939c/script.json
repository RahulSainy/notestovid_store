A car accelerates from rest at two meters per second squared for five seconds. We want to find the car's final velocity and the distance it travels. First identify the known variables initial velocity is zero acceleration is two meters per second squared and time is five seconds. Using the equation v equals u plus at we find the final velocity to be ten meters per second.
