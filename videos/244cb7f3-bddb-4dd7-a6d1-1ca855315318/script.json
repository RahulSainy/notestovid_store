Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of AI. But first, let's define what it actually is. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is basically making computers think and learn like humans. It's about teaching machines to solve problems, make decisions, and even learn from experience. \n\n#", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://as2.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/07/32/15/41/1000_F_732154168_KVCVYv9hBJ9XZovtsMG9pDattgovH3v6.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/244cb7f3-bddb-4dd7-a6d1-1ca855315318/images/image_1.webp"}, {"title": "Types of AI", "image_desc": "A diagram with three circles representing Narrow AI, General AI, and Super AI, with their respective characteristics listed within each circle.", "content": ["- **Narrow AI:** Designed for specific tasks, like playing chess or recognizing faces.", "**General AI:** Aims to create machines with human-level intelligence capable of performing any intellectual task.", "**Super AI:** Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence in all aspects."], "narration": "Now, AI comes in different flavors. We have Narrow AI, which is good at one specific thing, like playing chess or recognizing your face on Facebook. Then there's General AI, which is still a dream, but aims to create machines that can do anything a human can. And finally, we have Super AI, which is even more futuristic, where machines become smarter than humans in every way.\n\n#", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "https://www.analytixlabs.co.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-08-1-1-1536x522.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/244cb7f3-bddb-4dd7-a6d1-1ca855315318/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "How AI Works", "image_desc": "A flowchart showing the process of data input, training, and output in a machine learning model.", "content": ["- **Machine Learning:** AI systems learn from data without explicit programming.", "**Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning using artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain.", "**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enables computers to understand and process human language."], "narration": "So how does AI actually work? It's all about learning. Machine learning is like teaching a computer without giving it specific instructions. It learns from data, like a child learning from experience. Deep learning is a powerful type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain.
