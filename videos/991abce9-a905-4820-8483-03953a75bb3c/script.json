As you can see in the diagram, an input pass transistor controls the data input to the first inverter.  A feedback transistor provides a path from the output of the second inverter back to the input of the first.  The LOAD signal, combined with a clock phase, controls the input pass transistor.  Crucially, clock phase +2 controls the feedback path, ensuring data retention.", "image_url": "/data/videos/991abce9-a905-4820-8483-03953a75bb3c/images/image_2.webp", "image_path": "data/videos/991abce9-a905-4820-8483-03953a75bb3c/images/image_2.webp"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "Data Storage and Retention", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "When LOAD is high, data is written to the cell.\nWhen LOAD is low, the feedback path maintains the stored value.\nFeedback path reinforcement is crucial for data integrity.\nMaximum time for clock phase +2 is limited to maintain data integrity.", "image_desc": "A waveform diagram showing the LOAD signal, clock phases, and the data output of the register cell over time.", "narration": "Data is written to the cell when the LOAD signal is high.
