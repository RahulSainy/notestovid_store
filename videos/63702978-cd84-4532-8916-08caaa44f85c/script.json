Multiplexers allow us to transmit multiple signals over a single channel, while demultiplexers allow us to separate these signals at the receiving end. Imagine a busy highway with multiple lanes merging into one. A multiplexer is like the merging point, combining all the traffic into a single lane. Conversely, a demultiplexer is like a fork in the road, separating the traffic into multiple lanes again.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/86/f9/2f86f9f00f550c8c4eabdb7ddf9db288.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/63702978-cd84-4532-8916-08caaa44f85c/images/image_1.webp"}]
