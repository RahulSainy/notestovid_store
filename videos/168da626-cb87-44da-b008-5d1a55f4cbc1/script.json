Two common are as follows \n**Wet Oxidation**\nUses water vapor\nTemperature: 900-1000\u00b0C\nFaster growth rate\n**Dry Oxidation**\nUses pure oxygen\nTemperature: around 1200\u00b0C\nSlower growth rate, higher quality oxide", "image_desc": "A simple diagram comparing wet and dry oxidation processes, showing the different atmospheres used.", "narration": "There are two primary methods for silicon oxidation: wet and dry oxidation. Wet oxidation uses water vapor at temperatures between nine hundred and one thousand degrees Celsius, resulting in a faster growth rate. Dry oxidation uses pure oxygen at around twelve hundred degrees Celsius, producing a higher-quality oxide layer, albeit more slowly.", "image_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nzF8f6ocqXo/hqdefault.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/168da626-cb87-44da-b008-5d1a55f4cbc1/images/image_3.webp"}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "The Oxidation Process: A Visual Explanation", "slide_type": "Image with Caption", "content": "In the oxidation process, silicon is consumed. Because Si02 has\napproximately twice the volume of silicon, the Si02 layer grows almost equally in both vertical directions.
