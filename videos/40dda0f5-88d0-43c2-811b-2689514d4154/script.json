[{"slide_number": "1", "title": "Understanding the Cosine Curve", "slide_type": "Image Left", "content": "A cosine curve is a trigonometric function.\nIt's a smooth, periodic wave.\nIts values oscillate between -1 and 1.", "image_desc": "A graph showing a cosine wave, clearly illustrating its peaks, troughs, and periodicity.  The x-axis should represent the angle (in radians or degrees), and the y-axis should represent the cosine value.", "narration": "Hello everyone, today we're going to explore the cosine curve.  A cosine curve is a type of trigonometric function, which means it describes a wave-like pattern.  Notice how smoothly it oscillates, moving between a maximum value of one and a minimum value of negative one.  This repeating pattern makes it a periodic function, meaning it repeats itself after a certain interval. We'll be looking at its properties and applications in more detail.", "image_url": "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/J8285R/cosine-graph-J8285R.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/40dda0f5-88d0-43c2-811b-2689514d4154/images/image_1.webp"}]
