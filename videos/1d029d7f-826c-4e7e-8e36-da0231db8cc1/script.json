Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technology used to convert different types of documents\u2014such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images taken by a digital camera\u2014into editable and searchable data. TTS, on the other hand, converts text into spoken words, allowing users to listen to written content. The paper describes how the OCR and TTS system helps low-vision users by reducing eye strain and enabling auditory learning. It consists of three main modules: the Image Acquisition Module, the Processing Module, and the Output Module. The Image Acquisition Module captures and preprocesses images, the Processing Module includes OCR and TTS units, and the Output Module delivers the results in text and audio formats.", "slide_number": "4", "image_url": "/data/videos/1d029d7f-826c-4e7e-8e36-da0231db8cc1/images/image_4.webp", "image_path": "data/videos/1d029d7f-826c-4e7e-8e36-da0231db8cc1/images/image_4.webp"}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": ["- The paper reviews existing systems for text-to-speech conversion and character recognition.", "Sneha C.
