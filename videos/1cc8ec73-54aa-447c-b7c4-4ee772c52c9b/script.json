The N-MOSFET is built on a P-type silicon substrate.  Embedded within are two N-type regions, the source and drain.  These are separated by a channel region.  A thin layer of insulating silicon dioxide, the gate oxide, sits atop the channel region, and a metal or polysilicon gate is placed on top of the oxide.", "image_url": "https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/n-channelmosfet-enhancement-type.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/1cc8ec73-54aa-447c-b7c4-4ee772c52c9b/images/image_2.webp"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "N-MOSFET Operation: Cut-off Region", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "Gate voltage (Vg) is less than the threshold voltage (Vt).\nNo channel exists between source and drain.\nNo current flows between source and drain.", "image_desc": "A diagram showing an N-MOSFET with a gate voltage below the threshold voltage.
