The Apriori algorithm is a classic approach used in data mining to discover frequent itemsets in transactional databases. It identifies associations between items by finding itemsets that appear frequently together. However, the original Apriori algorithm has a major drawback: it requires multiple scans of the database, which can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially with large datasets.", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "/data/videos/af18fabc-af23-4edc-887e-d03519ac5e35/images/image_2.webp", "image_path": "data/videos/af18fabc-af23-4edc-887e-d03519ac5e35/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "Introducing Apriori CDB: A Caching Solution", "content": ["- Apriori with Cache Database (Apriori CDB): Improves Apriori efficiency by minimizing database scans.", "Approach:\n    - Scans the database once to create a cache database using a hash map.\n    - Subsequent searches are conducted on the cache database, not the original."], "image_desc": "A flow chart depicting the steps involved in the Apriori CDB algorithm, including initial database scan, cache creation, and subsequent searches on the cache.", "narration": "The paper by Asthana and Singh proposes an innovative solution to this inefficiency. Their approach introduces a new algorithm, referred to as Apriori with Cache Database (Apriori CDB). This algorithm aims to improve the efficiency of the Apriori algorithm by minimizing the number of database scans required. Here's how it works: Instead of repeatedly scanning the entire database, the proposed algorithm scans the database just once. During this initial scan, it creates a cache database using a hash map to store information about each transaction. This cache is then used for subsequent searches, dramatically reducing the overhead of scanning the entire database for every operation.", "slide_number": "3", "image_url": "/data/videos/af18fabc-af23-4edc-887e-d03519ac5e35/images/image_3.webp", "image_path": "data/videos/af18fabc-af23-4edc-887e-d03519ac5e35/images/image_3.webp"}, {"title": "Leveraging Hash Functions and Binary Strings", "content": ["- Hash Functions: Map data to fixed size for quick access.", "Binary Strings: Represent data presence/absence."], "image_desc": "A diagram illustrating how hash functions and binary strings are used in the Apriori CDB algorithm.", "narration": "The authors leverage hash functions and binary strings to create this cache database.
