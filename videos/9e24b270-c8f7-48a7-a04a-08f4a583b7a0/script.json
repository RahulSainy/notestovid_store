[{"title": "Centripetal Force", "content": ["- **Definition:** Centripetal force is a force that acts on an object moving in a circular path and is directed towards the center of the circle.", "**Cause:** It is the force that causes the object to change direction and follow a curved path.", "**Examples:**\n    - The force of gravity acting on a satellite orbiting Earth.\n    - The tension in a string holding a ball swinging in a circle.\n    - The friction between a car's tires and the road as it turns."], "image_desc": "A ball attached to a string, swinging in a circular path. The string represents the centripetal force acting on the ball, pulling it towards the center of the circle.", "narration": "Centripetal force is a crucial concept in physics, explaining why objects move in circular paths. It's the force that constantly pulls an object towards the center of its circular motion, preventing it from moving in a straight line. Imagine a ball tied to a string, swinging in a circle. The string represents the centripetal force, pulling the ball towards the center. Without this force, the ball would fly off in a straight line.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://slideplayer.com/slide/12883199/78/images/15/path+of+ball+if+the+string.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/9e24b270-c8f7-48a7-a04a-08f4a583b7a0/images/image_1.webp"}]
