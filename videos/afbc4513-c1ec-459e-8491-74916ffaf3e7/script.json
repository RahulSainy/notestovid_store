It's made by wrapping a wire around a metal core and then sending electricity through the wire. The more electricity you send, the stronger the magnet becomes. It's pretty cool, right?", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://c8.alamy.com/comp/GN6D9M/magnetic-field-of-a-current-carrying-coil-electromagnetic-coil-conductor-GN6D9M.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/afbc4513-c1ec-459e-8491-74916ffaf3e7/images/image_1.webp"}, {"title": "Uses of Electromagnets", "image_desc": "A collage of images showing various applications of electromagnets, such as a motor, a magnetic levitation train, an MRI machine, a doorbell, and a speaker.", "content": ["- Electromagnets are used in a wide variety of applications, including:\n    - Motors and generators\n    - Magnetic levitation trains\n    - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines\n    - Doorbells and speakers"], "narration": "Electromagnets are used in all sorts of things! They power motors and generators, help trains float in the air, create detailed images of our bodies in MRI machines, and even make our doorbells ring and speakers play music.
