It's essential for seeing clearly, especially in dim light. Vitamin A helps create rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that allows us to detect light.  Without enough vitamin A, our ability to see in low light diminishes, leading to night blindness. In severe cases, prolonged deficiency can even cause irreversible vision loss.", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "/data/videos/b1809de3-8f84-4f06-ae51-9c76b5e7affb/images/image_2.webp", "image_path": "data/videos/b1809de3-8f84-4f06-ae51-9c76b5e7affb/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "Vitamin A's Role in Immune Function", "image_desc": "A microscopic image depicting white blood cells engulfing bacteria, representing the immune system's defense mechanism.", "content": ["- Vitamin A plays a crucial role in immune system function.", "It helps maintain the integrity of the skin and mucous membranes, acting as a barrier against infections.", "It also supports the production of white blood cells, which fight off infections."], "narration": "Beyond vision, vitamin A is a powerhouse for our immune system.
