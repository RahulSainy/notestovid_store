It refers to the energy associated with the temperature of a system.  Think of it as the energy stored within a system due to the random motion of its constituent particles. The hotter the system, the more energetic these particles are, and the greater the thermostatic energy.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qZQWfYPmcwbqm01DxYccX8FST12pGeFkjnHdOmbJlzKYUVJ0nt-sQa9WKnb0xqsh0vqiS0d9CyewLcK9gpyWBHc7VUk0uK6zrmaU1HNS99at13ewczSWUr2JKITaUYPc1-8GDHW7", "image_path": "data/videos/d63e5446-95f5-426a-a3b0-412b8e0e3a28/images/image_1.webp"}]
