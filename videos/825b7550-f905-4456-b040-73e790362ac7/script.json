For example, organic chemistry deals with carbon-containing compounds, while inorganic chemistry focuses on all other compounds.  Physical chemistry explores the physical properties of matter and how they relate to chemical reactions, while analytical chemistry helps us understand the composition and structure of matter.", "image_url": "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LFU8OzbezEo/XsN_mpl-qFI/AAAAAAAAAVc/oTy4GDUxDe4gLfmKhoWLCIoeX_3hNX0fgCK4BGAYYCw/s1600/chemistry-and-its-branches-interconnection-between-branches-of-chemistry.png", "image_path": "data/videos/825b7550-f905-4456-b040-73e790362ac7/images/image_2.webp"}]
