It's a combination of different components working together to ensure accurate and secure attendance tracking. First, we have the fingerprint sensor, which captures and stores unique biometric data for each user. This helps ensure that the person marking attendance is indeed who they claim to be. Then, there's the face detection sensor, which adds an extra layer of security by confirming identity through facial recognition. To enable wireless communication, the system utilizes Zigbee and GSM modules. Zigbee is used for transmitting data, while GSM modules handle notifications and alerts. Finally, a user-friendly Android application simplifies the process of marking attendance and managing data.", "slide_number": "4", "image_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/sensors/sensors-21-03784/article_deploy/html/images/sensors-21-03784-g014.png", "image_path": "data/videos/8958ab14-855a-453a-a3e4-3dded58df24e/images/image_4.webp"}, {"title": "Working Principles", "content": ["- Fingerprint Recognition: Involves capturing the fingerprint image, enhancing it for clarity, detecting edges using histogram equalization and Prewitt operators, and extracting and matching features.", "Face Detection: Utilizes the Viola-Jones algorithm, which involves Haar features, integral image computation, and AdaBoost for accurate face detection.", "GSM Module: Handles sending notifications and alerts, ensuring real-time communication with relevant personnel."], "image_desc": "A diagram showcasing the working principles of the system, including the steps involved in fingerprint recognition, face detection, and GSM module communication.", "narration": "Let's break down how these components work together.
