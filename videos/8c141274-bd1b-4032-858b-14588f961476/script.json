First, it promotes stateless communication, meaning each request is independent and doesn't rely on previous interactions. This makes REST services highly scalable and reliable. Second, REST follows a client-server architecture, where clients request resources from servers. This separation of concerns simplifies development and maintenance.", "image_url": "https://www.slideteam.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1280x720/p/y/pyramid_diagram_with_five_layers_for_layered_architecture_infographic_template_slide01.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/8c141274-bd1b-4032-858b-14588f961476/images/image_2.webp"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "Benefits of REST", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "Simplicity and Ease of Use\nScalability and Performance\nFlexibility and Extensibility\nWidely Adopted and Supported", "image_desc": "[Image Description in English only: A graphic showcasing the benefits of REST, such as simplicity and scalability.]", "narration": "REST offers numerous benefits.
