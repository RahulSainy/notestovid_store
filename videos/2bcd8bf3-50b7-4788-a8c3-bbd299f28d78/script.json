It's highly extensible, allowing developers to customize it for specific requirements.  Importantly, SOAP is language and platform independent, meaning it can be used by applications written in different programming languages and running on different operating systems. This makes it incredibly versatile for building applications that need to communicate across diverse environments. SOAP also standardizes messaging, ensuring consistent communication formats and methods, which simplifies development and maintenance.

The HTTP POST method is commonly used for sending data to the server, while the HTTP GET method is used for retrieving data from the server.  The HTTP request includes headers, such as Content Length and Content Type, which provide information about the message content.  A SOAP method utilizes the HTTP request/response mechanism, ensuring that the request is processed by the server, and a response is sent back to the client.
