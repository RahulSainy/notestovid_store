It has several important properties that make it useful for signal processing, such as linearity, time invariance, and frequency invariance. These properties allow us to manipulate and analyze signals in the Z-domain, which can be easier than working directly in the time domain. The Z-transform also has theorems that allow us to determine the initial and final values of a signal from its Z-transform.", "slide_number": "1", "image_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DvWSYhcXf3U/maxresdefault.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/68053ed4-4f43-472c-a150-04347f1b7509/images/image_1.webp"}]
