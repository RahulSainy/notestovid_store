Matrices are like grids filled with numbers. They have rows and columns, and their dimensions tell us how many rows and columns they have. For matrix multiplication to work, the number of columns in the first matrix has to match the number of rows in the second matrix. Think of it like fitting puzzle pieces together.\n\n#", "slide_number": "2", "image_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VzBiJ0_GzQk/maxresdefault.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/581d9153-d671-4133-83c0-b97a11edd2f4/images/image_2.webp"}, {"title": "The Multiplication Process", "image_desc": "A step-by-step illustration of matrix multiplication, showing the calculation of a single element in the resulting matrix using the dot product of a row and a column.", "content": ["- Each element in the resulting matrix is calculated by taking the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix.", "The dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding elements.", "The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix."], "narration": "Now, let's see how the multiplication actually happens. Each element in the new matrix is calculated by multiplying a row from the first matrix with a column from the second matrix. We do this by multiplying corresponding elements and adding them all up.
