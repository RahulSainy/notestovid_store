Type: diagram", "video_desc": "", "narration": "The five five five timer IC is an eightpin device. Pin one is the ground which provides the zero voltage reference for the circuit. Pin two is the trigger input which initiates the timer cycle. Pin three is the output pin where the timer's output signal is available. Pin four is the reset pin which can be used to interrupt the timing cycle. Pin five is the control voltage pin which allows external control of the timer's threshold and trigger levels. Pin six is the threshold input which compares the voltage at this pin to a reference voltage to end the timing cycle. Pin seven is the discharge pin which is connected to an internal transistor that discharges the timing capacitor. Finally pin eight is VCC which is the positive supply voltage for the IC.", "image_urls": ["https://www.electronicsforu.com/wp-contents/uploads/2022/11/555-Timer-Pin-Diagram.png"], "image_path": "data/videos/4d995b7b-0305-4842-afb5-2b6937b91ddb/images/image_2.webp", "video_urls": ["No Video Found"], "video_path": "data/videos/4d995b7b-0305-4842-afb5-2b6937b91ddb/images/video_2.mp4"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "Pin Functions Explained: Trigger and Threshold", "slide_type": "Two Columns", "content": "**Trigger (Pin Two)**\nActive low input.\nInitiates the timing cycle when voltage drops below one-third of VCC.\nUsed in monostable and astable modes.\n**Threshold (Pin Six)**\nCompares voltage to two-thirds of VCC.\nWhen voltage exceeds this level, the output switches state.\nDetermines the end of the timing cycle.", "image_desc": "555 timer trigger threshold. Type: illustration", "video_desc": "", "narration": "Let's delve deeper into two important pins the trigger and the threshold. The trigger pin is an active low input meaning it starts the timing cycle when its voltage drops below onethird of the supply voltage VCC. This pin is crucial for both monostable and astable modes of operation. The threshold pin on the other hand compares its voltage to twothirds of VCC.
