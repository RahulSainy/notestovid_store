Robots in a swarm operate independently, making decisions based on their local environment. They self-organize, adapting to changing conditions without needing a central controller. This decentralized approach makes swarms robust, meaning the loss of a few robots won't cripple the entire system. And finally, swarms are easily scalable, allowing for the addition or removal of robots as needed.", "image_url": "https://circuitdigest.com/sites/default/files/projectimage_news/Researchers-Build-Four-Legged-Swarm-Robots-Using-3D-Printer.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/1a7a6b12-0c33-483d-9dbd-2d5b992e118b/images/image_3.webp"}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "Applications of Swarm Robotics", "slide_type": "Two Columns", "content": "**Column 1: Title: Search and Rescue**\nLocating survivors in disaster areas.\nExploring hazardous environments.\nMapping and surveying unknown terrain.\n**Column 2: Title: Environmental Monitoring**\nTracking pollution levels.\nMonitoring wildlife populations.\nCollecting data on climate change.", "image_desc": "[Image Description in English only: Two images, one showing a swarm of robots searching for survivors in a disaster area, and the other showing a swarm of robots collecting data on pollution levels.]", "narration": "The applications of swarm robotics are vast and diverse.
