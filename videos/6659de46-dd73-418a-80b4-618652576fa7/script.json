This means we don't provide the algorithm with pre-labeled data; it learns the structure on its own.  It groups similar data points into clusters, revealing hidden patterns.

Algorithms like K-Means and K-Medoids divide the data into a pre-defined number of clusters, K.  The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster while maximizing the variance between clusters.  A key limitation is that you need to specify the number of clusters beforehand.", "image_url": "http://dendroid.sk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/kmeansimg-scaled1000.jpg?w=300", "image_path": "data/videos/6659de46-dd73-418a-80b4-618652576fa7/images/image_3.webp"}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "Hierarchical Clustering", "slide_type": "Image with Caption", "content": "Algorithm: Agglomerative Clustering\nBuilds a tree-like structure (dendrogram)\nDoesn't require specifying the number of clusters", "image_desc": "A dendrogram showing the hierarchical clustering of data points.", "narration": "Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters, represented as a dendrogram.
