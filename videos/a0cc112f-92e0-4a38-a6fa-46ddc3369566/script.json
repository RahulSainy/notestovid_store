We have a p-type silicon substrate.  Notice the two heavily doped n-type regions: the source and the drain.  These are separated by a thin layer of silicon dioxide, acting as an insulator, and on top sits the metal gate electrode.", "image_url": "https://www.mks.com/mam/celum/celum_assets/Figure_11-Semiconductor_Handbook_800w.jpg", "image_path": "data/videos/a0cc112f-92e0-4a38-a6fa-46ddc3369566/images/image_2.webp"}, {"slide_number": "3", "title": "Source, Drain, and Gate Terminals", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "Source: Electrons enter.\nDrain: Electrons leave.\nGate: Controls channel formation.", "image_desc": "A close-up diagram highlighting the source, drain, and gate terminals of the NMOS transistor.
